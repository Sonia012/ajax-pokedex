# Description

Beginning of February 2019: exercise about ajax. The purpose was to make a Pokedex. Therefore, we had to fetch data from the [Pokemon api](https://pokeapi.co/).

As it was not about the CSS, we were allowed to use a CSS template, which we did.  The CSS was taken from [this codepen](https://codepen.io/rocherf/pen/ZvxdxR) and we tweaked it according to our needs.

These were the instructions we received:
- you have to be able to search for Pokemons by name
- you need to show the following information about the searched Pokemon:
        * ID-number
        * image
        * at least 4 "moves"
        * the previous evolution (incl. image), if there is one

# How it works

Go to the [published site](https://sonia012.github.io/ajax-pokedex/).  If you type the name of a Pokemon in the "Research" input bar (bottom left of the screen), and then press enter, you will get all the information about that Pokemon.


# Progress

The butoons "Shiny", "Front" and "Back" don't work for now.  We are only showing the front image. This could be improved in the future.
